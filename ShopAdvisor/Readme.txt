Project Name    : ShopAdvisor

Description     : This is an application software written in "JAVA" programming language. 
		  In this application we are going to have a user interface to enable 2 types of user to sign in -
										1. Seller of products
										2. Buyer of products.
		  Sellers will be able to add or edit the data of their products and the Buyers can only check and review 
                  the products as well as can put desired items on their wish list.
		
		  We are going to handle different types of data of different products and then find and show the best 
                  deals for the buyers.This program will show he buyers to find the product of lowest price.Thus this 
                  program will help/advise users about shopping.
                  The aim of our project is to focus our work on UI(user interface) and Networking (Multiple PC 
                  Connection).
