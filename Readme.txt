Project Name    : ShopAdvisor

Description     : This is an application software written in "JAVA" programming language. Here we intend to focus our work on UI(user interface) and 
		  Networking (Multiple PC connection).
		  In this application we are going to have a user interface to enable 2 types of user to sign in -
										1. Seller of products
										2. Buyer of products.
		  Sellers will be able to add or edit the data of their products and the Buyers can only check and riview the products as well as can 
		  put desired items on their wish list.
		
		  We are going to handle different types of data of different products and then find and show the best deals for the buyers.This program 
		  will show he buyers to find the product of lowest price.Thus this program will help/advise users about shopping.

		  N.B. : We will try to provide to find the best selling products (not sorted by price) sorted by reviews, if we can complete thge previous 
		  aspects.
